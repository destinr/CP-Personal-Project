Plain Meaning Survey Site

Background: Textual legal analysis often relies on the "plain meaning" of statutes and codes. Unfortunately, “plain meanings” aren’t so plain; there are often a multitude of valid readings of a particular word or phrase. Textualist judges are left to determine what the “plainest” meaning is based on their own instincts and preferences. This leads to arbitrary decision making and has had a profound impact on the validity of the American judicial system. 

Potential solution: Survey data could help jurists determine the average “plain meaning” of relevant words. Providing a database of user-submitted definitions could provide a common baseline for textual analysis and prevent radical definitions from being canonized in case law. 

Project goals:
  1. Connect with the Caselaw Access Project API (https://case.law/docs/site_features/api) to create a database of words whose "plain meaning" impact the decision of state/federal cases.
  2. Establish a database for collecting user-generated "plain meanings" for relevant words. 
  3. Create user interface that serves visitors 5 words at a time to define. 
  4. Profit.
